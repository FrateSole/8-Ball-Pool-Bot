# 8 Ball Pool Bot

This is an Open Source project that aims to build a bot that can play Miniclip's **8 ball pool** through the use of an AI.

Current features:
- Open 8 ball pool in focus mode.
- Check if the user is logged in.

Future ideas:
- Transform the console app into a GUI app.
- Implement object detection.
- Figure out the game's velocities and 'drag' values.
- Include some form of search to find the most optimal hit.
